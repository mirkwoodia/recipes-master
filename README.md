git init = intialize git directory in your current directory/folder (use cd desktop or downloads/recipes-master first)
git add . = adds the rep
git branch = shows what branch your using (avoid using Master)
git branch nameOfBranch = create a new branch
git checkout nameOfBranch = switch to a different branch

you have to update the Master branch for it to catch up

emacs -nw README.md
emacs = editor
-nw = new window??
git merge nameOfBranch = merge branches (I think its a one way transfer of info)
